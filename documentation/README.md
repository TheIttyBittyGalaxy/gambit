# Documentation

This folder contains a quick reference for each feature in the language. As the language design is still being worked on, many files contain rough notes and write-ups, rather than concise reference information.

If you're not sure where to start, [entities](entity.md) and [properties](property.md) are probably the way to go. They're the features that differ most from other languages you may be used to, and are also further along in their implementation. ([notations](notation.md) are also a very cool idea, but they aren't implemented!)

> // TODO: Once the language is more established, write some more useful guides, that explain features in tandem and help someone get started with the language.

<!-- FIXME: Agree on a title case convention for the repo (or at least the documentation). At the moment I'm using sentence case, and I'm not sure if I like that or not. -->
