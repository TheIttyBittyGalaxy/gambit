# ‚öîÔ∏è Card Attack

**Card attack is a two-player card game, created just for testing Gambit.**

## üìú How to play

### Starting the game

At the start of the game, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 8 cards. Lay your cards face up in front of you, where you and your opponent can see them. Each player is also given 10 tokens.

The goal of the game is to have the most tokens when the game ends.

### Player turns

Players take turns. On their turn, each player takes the following steps in order:

1. If you like, choose one of your cards. Add as many of your tokens as you like onto the card. (You cannot use tokens that you have already put on other cards).
2. If you like, choose two of your cards, and 'attack' an opponent card (see below).
3. If both players have _less than_ 2 cards left, the game is over. The player with the most tokens wins.

### Attacking

Every card had a 'power' score. A card's power is it's rank plus how many tokens it has. (Jack, Queen, and King are 10; Ace is 11).

When you attack, you choose two of your cards (the 'attackers'), and one of your opponent's cards (the 'defender'). In order to attack, the combined power of the attackers must be _more than_ the power of the defender. Additionally, at least one of your attackers must match the suit of the defender.

When you have attacked successfully, discard the defender, and gain an amount of tokens equal to it's power. Also, discard your weakest attacker, but take back any tokens it has. If your attackers have equal power, you may choose which is discarded.
